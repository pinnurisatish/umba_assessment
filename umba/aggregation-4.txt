-- aggregation question-4: smallest loan size per month
-- used aggregate function 'MIN' on 'amount' column, then extracted(extract() method) month and year from the 'created' date column. 
-- used 'group by' to group the results by month and the year. Finally sorted the results based on recency (latest created comes on top)!

select min(amount) as min_amount, extract(month FROM created) as month, extract(year FROM created) as year from loans 
group by month, year 
order by year desc, month desc;
