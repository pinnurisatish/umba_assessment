-- aggregation question-1: number of loans per month
-- used aggregate function 'COUNT' on 'id' column, then extracted(extract() method) month and year from the 'created' date column. 
-- used 'group by' to group the results by month and the year. Finally sorted the results based on recency (latest created comes on top)!

SELECT count(id), extract(month FROM created) as month, extract(year FROM created) as year from loans 
group by month, year 
order by year desc, month desc;
